      <p class="main_text black">Fayuan Temple is a historical community in Xijiao Hutong in Beijing. What makes Fayuan Community is even more special is that there&#x27;s a historical temple in the community. As the city has modernized rapidly, the Hutong community has turned into an over-crowded area. As such, residents could not fully appreciate and connect to the historical culture and buildings around them.<br></p>

      <p class="main_text black">We pick “treasure hunt” as the theme for the event and constraint the area of the event to the Fayuan Hutong, with the three Assembly Halls as the key locations for the treasure hunt. This way, we can naturally weave in the historical stories into the games and make sure the events are fun and interesting.<br></p>

          <p class="main_text black">The key consists of three components, and the players will find three potential pieces for each component. Only one out of the three pieces are “real”. The player can only open the treasure box after combining the three “real” pieces.<br></p>

      <p class="main_text-bd black">Design shortfall:<br></p>
